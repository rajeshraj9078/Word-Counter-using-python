# Word-Counter-using-python
The Word Counter project is a simple Python program designed to count the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. This project is part of a Python Programming Internship. It aims to strengthen your understanding of fundamental Python concepts such as input handling, string manipulation, function creation, control flow, and output display.

# Project Objectives 
**Input Handling :** Learn how to take user input in Python.

**String Manipulation:** Explore string manipulation techniques for text processing.

**Function Creation:** Practice creating functions in Python for modular code.

**Basic Control Flow:** Implement basic control flow structures to control the program's logic. Output Display: Display the word count as the output of the program.

# Features 
**User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.

**Word Counting Logic:** A function is implemented to count the number of words in the input.

**Output Display:** The word count is printed to the console.

**Error Handling:** The program accounts for potential errors, such as empty input.

**Code Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The program ensures a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output.
